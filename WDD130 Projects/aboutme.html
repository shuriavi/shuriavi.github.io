        I have lived in Washington all my life around the Olympia area. I love the rain so it's definitely a good place
        to live. I have 7 siblings so there are 6 girls and 2 boys including me. My family is super close and we all
        enjoy playing soccer a lot. My dad is from Papua New Guinea so we didn't have a typical American childhood. We
        were definitely influenced a lot by his culture.

        I have not served a mission as I am not old enough, but I do hope to.

        I am a Computer Science Major and hope to work in managemnet to help make decisions on what computer scientists
        should do to benefit the company.

        I love learning new things and meeting new people. I work in the Math Tutoring Center and meet a lot of people
        like that.
        Also my favorite candy is the watchamacallit bars.
